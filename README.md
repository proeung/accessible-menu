# accessible-menu

A sandbox app that demonstrates WCAG accessible mega menu using Tailwind CSS v.3 and extending from Disclosure Menus.

To get started:

1. Install the dependencies:

    ```bash
    # Using npm
    npm install

    # Using Yarn
    yarn
    ```

2. Start the development server:

    ```bash
    # Using npm
    npm run serve

    # Using Yarn
    yarn run serve
    ```

    Now you should be able to see the project running at localhost:8080.

3. Open `public/index.html` in your editor and start experimenting!

## Building for production

To build an optimized version of your CSS, simply run:

```bash
# Using npm
npm run production

# Using Yarn

```

After that's done, check out `./public/build/style.css` to see the optimized output.
